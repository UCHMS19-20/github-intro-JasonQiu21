#Assignment Question - What is Git?

Git is a *version control system* created by Linus Torvalds. 
It is useful for programming because it makes collaborating, rolling back versions, etc easy

It is also an easy command to make puns with:

    git gud --now

##Commands
    git push
    git commit
    git add
    git init
(not in that order)
